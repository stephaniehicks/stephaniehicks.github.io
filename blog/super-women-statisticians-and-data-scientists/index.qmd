Picture it. It was 2018 and I had just started my tenure-track faculty job at Hopkins and I was coming off maternity leave where I welcomed my beautiful 2nd baby into the world. Sleepless nights, crazy juggling, also wanting to soak up every moment I could with our baby boy. At the time, I was constantly looking up baby books and science/math themed children's books to read to our kids. Now to be clear, there are so many great books out there, but somehow I felt they were not quite what I was looking for. What is I was looking for? 

- What if it focused in statistics? 
- What if it focused in data science? 
- What if featured women in these fields? 

Fast forward to today: International Women's Day 2023.  

It is with the greatest honor and privilege to share with you a new book called **_Super Women: Growing Up to be Statisticians and Data Scientists_**!

I just want to say thank you so much to Jessica Crowell who poured an enormous amount of creativity, energy, and design expertise into this book. Without you, this book would not be here today. 

I also want to deeply and sincerely say thank you to the women who shared a part of themselves and allowed us to try and capture it in this book!

To the world -- I hope it brings you as much joy, happiness, and inspiration as it does for me each time I read it.
