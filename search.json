    "text": "Picture it. It was 2018 and I had just started my tenure-track faculty job at Hopkins and I was coming off maternity leave where I welcomed my beautiful 2nd baby into the world. Sleepless nights, crazy juggling, also wanting to soak up every moment I could with our baby boy. At the time, I was constantly looking up baby books and science/math themed children’s books to read to our kids. Now to be clear, there are so many great books out there, but somehow I felt they were not quite what I was looking for. What is I was looking for?\n\nWhat if it focused in statistics?\nWhat if it focused in data science?\nWhat if featured women in these fields?\n\nFast forward to today: International Women’s Day 2023.\nIt is with the greatest honor and privilege to share with you a new book called Super Women: Growing Up to be Statisticians and Data Scientists!\nYou can find out about the project and book here: https://www.stephaniehicks.com/superwomen\n\nIt is a children’s book that features eleven amazing women statisticians and data scientists.\n\nOn each page of the book, one woman is featured with the left side of the page describing the individual when she was young and the right side of the page describing the individual today.\n\nI just want to say thank you so much to Jessica Crowell who poured an enormous amount of creativity, energy, and design expertise into this book. Without you, this book would not be here today.\nI also want to deeply and sincerely say thank you to the women who shared a part of themselves and allowed us to try and capture it in this book!\nTo the world – I hope it brings you as much joy, happiness, and inspiration as it does for me each time I read it.\n\nFAQs for Educators and Caregivers\n\nEditors and illustrators of the book\nThe book was edited by Stephanie Hicks and Jessica Crowell and illustrated by Jessica Crowell with an incredible amount of support from the Super Women Team.\n\nJessica Crowell is a videographer and editor, trained at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), and now in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins, where she works with faculty and staff on multimedia projects as part of work in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab.\nStephanie Hicks is a problem-forward scientist who uses statistics and data science tools to solve real-world problems in the biomedical data sciences. She is passionate about contributing to and supporting initiatives that promote justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.\n\n\n\nWhy this book?\nWith this book, we aim to provide a playground of imagination for children to learn about statistics and data science by highlighting the stories of several individuals in these fields. We hope this inspires the next generation to learn more about these fields and how they can be used to help make the world brighter.\n\n\nHow do I access the book?\nThe children’s book is freely available now to download as a PDF on the Get the book page.\nAlso, we are in the process of working with the American Statistical Association to make the book available on Amazon, in case someone would like a physical copy. Proceeds from this will go towards supporting the Gertrude M. Cox Scholarship."

As a committee we meet quarterly to discuss goals that we set for ourselves and progress to date on those goals. One of our goals is to make better use of the @WomenInStat twitter handle, which is run by members of our committee.\nIn our Q2 meeting in May 2020, Lucy had a wonderful suggestion of using the @WomenInStat twitter account to uplift the voices of female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) in Statistics and Data Science by hosting weekly a rotating curator (RoCur)! We will be using the hashtag #WSDS to stand for Women in Statistics and Data Science, but we define this to be inclusive to female and minority genders with this hashtag.\n🗣 Starting next week, we are using this account to hightlight and uplift #WSDS voices by hosting rotating curators! Interested in curating for a week?ℹ️ learn more: https://t.co/YffGVY46XU✍️ sign up: https://t.co/cioDRtxywb📆 check out our schedule: https://t.co/haDaK8LoEy pic.twitter.com/QxKQzqXG3V— Women in Statistics (@WomenInStat) June 1, 2020 \nThe idea is borrowed from the wonderful @WeAreRLadies twitter account which also hosts RoCurs for the @RLadiesGlobal community #rladies.\nLucy has done a fantastic job getting everything set up and we are now ready to launch!\n\nObjectives\nWe have two main objectives with the RoCurs:\n\nTo encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the Women in Statistics and Data Science community.\nTo spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in Statistics and Data Science.\n\n\n\nHow it will work?\nEvery week, a different person takes over our twitter account to talk about the work they do in statistics and data science.\nFeatured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences, from novice to expert.\n\n\nWeek 1 is dedicated to amplifying voices of Black scholars\nTo help make sure we’ve worked out all the kinks of getting this project launched, I offered to kick things off. Given complete tragedy we have watched unfold the last two weeks, I am dedicating my RoCur week to amplify voices of Black female scholars in Statistics and Data Science.\nWhile we still process recent horrific & senseless acts of violence, to be clear, @WomenInStat stands in solidarity against racism & inequity. #BlackLivesMatter📣 Our 1st week of #WSDS rotating curators will amplify voices of Black female scholars in #statistics & #datascience— Women in Statistics (@WomenInStat) June 4, 2020 \n\n\nWant to know more?\nIf you want to:\n\nlearn more, check out https://github.com/asacowis/rocur\nsign up to be a RoCur, check out: https://bit.ly/wsds-rocur\nsee who’s signed up already on our schedule: https://bit.ly/womeninstat-rocur-schedule\n\nWe have lined up a great set of RoCurs for the few months:\nWe are so excited about our #WSDS rotating curators. Next week we will be amplifying voices of Black scholars. Then we have @juliasilge, @ChelseaParlett, @siminaboca. Here's a sneak peak at who we have coming up next:Want to join?✍️ sign up: https://t.co/vHNyyG4BIM pic.twitter.com/2FiAV9JYce— Women in Statistics (@WomenInStat) June 4, 2020 \nBe sure to check out @WomenInStat every Monday for a new curator!"

I can’t say it has been a walk in the park — many hard lessons learned —, but I can say I love what I get to do everyday and feel incredibly fortunate to work here with such great colleagues and students!\nSo while reflecting on this past year, I have been thinking about many great blogposts I read containing information about how to enjoy being on the tenure-track and not stress out about it, including one of favorites, The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life. I don’t want reinvent the wheel, but thought I would echo a bit of advice that I’ve learned this year in terms of time management and productivity.\n\nLearn to polietly say no as much as humanly possible. Honestly, this is the thing I still struggle the most with, but I constantly remind myself everyday. Protect your time. It is much more valuable than you could ever imagine.\n\n\n\nBeing productive does not mean needing to spend hours in the office or working on the weekends. Learn to proritize and outsource. You can absolutely have a wonderful work-life balance and crush it as principal investigator (PI) with the right support team.\nIf all else fails and you feel like you are wasting time / spinning your wheels on something that’s confusing or unclear (e.g. the grants process, effort reporting, all things related to your home department or institution, or just need to vent), — which happened to me many, many times the past year — follow the flow chart given to me by one of my awesome faculty mentors, Jeff Leek and ask for help:\n\n\nHope everyone’s year is off to a great start!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the last few weeks, there have been quite a few great pre-prints posted on bioRxiv related to the analysis of a popular type of genomics data, called single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). The idea with this data is that you can measure genome-wide features (such as genes or transcripts) in individual cells, in contrast to more traditional bulk RNA-sequencing experiments where for each feature, you get an average of gene expression across all the cells in the sample. One key insight that has been widely talked about in the world of scRNA-seq data analysis is the over inflation of the number of zeros, or sparsity, of the data compared to bulk RNA-sequencing measurements. Therefore, for several years now, lots of work has been focused on developing zero-inflation aware methods. Many early contributions were based on what are commonly referred to as plate-based protocols as opposed to the more recently developed droplet-based protocols that have what are called unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) – little barcodes attached to the ends of the mRNA that remove certain biases related to PCR amplification. Here, I wanted to write up a quick blogpost summarizing one of the key takeaways that have come out from some recent pre-prints."

    "section": "Droplet-based scRNA-seq data with UMI counts are not zero inflated",
    "text": "Droplet-based scRNA-seq data with UMI counts are not zero inflated\nThere were hints of this in 2017 [Vieth et al. (2017) and a blogpost by Valentine Svensson in 2017], but several recent pre-prints have come out supporting this idea. Townes et al. (2019) showed UMI count data derived from negative control scRNA-seq datasets (i.e. identical RNA was added to droplets and sequenced aka we do not expect any biological variation) are well-described by multinomial distributions, which can be approximated by Poisson and negative binomial distributions. A few days later Hafemeister and Satija (2019) independently published similar results, with a different error distribution. The next day, Svensson et al. (2019) took the analysis from his 2017 blogpost and converted it into a pre-print. Here, he took five negative control droplet scRNA-seq datasets (again, identical RNA was added to droplets and sequenced aka we do not expect any biological variation), and showed how the data – well 4 out of 5 datasets – dropseq was a bit wonky) fit nicely to a negative binomial distribution. This matches what previous authors have found Vieth et al. (2017). Svensson argues this suggests an over-abundance of zeros in biological data is likely real biological variation, as opposed to technical variation, which also been suggested by Andrews and Hemberg (2018) as a way to identify genes that contain biologically meaningful information.\nBoth Townes and Svensson hypothesize that the zero-inflation in non-UMI data is related to the outliers in PCR duplicated counts, which is corrected by the use of UMIs. Svensson does not perform a similar assessment of plate-based scRNA-seq datasets because no comparable negative control data exists or plate-based methods. However, Svensson goes on to hypothesize that plate-based methods might introduce an additional layer out count noise leading to over dispersion and manifesting as additional zeros.\nWhat does this mean for the field going forward? This means that the choice of methods used for the analysis of scRNA-seq data will likely vary depending on the type of protocol used to generate that data. I guess this is not so suprising, but methods do matter and the assumptions behind those methods are important to think about. However, ultimately I’m just excited to see such great work from multiple groups all converge on a similar idea. Hope this helps to move the field forward."

    "text": "Making discoveries and contributing your ideas and/or work are fundamental components of being a scientist (I am treating of the word “scientist” very broadly here). However, another important component of being a scientist is learning how to build your “brand” as a scientist.\nI want to preface this blog post acknowledging there are huge differences across cultures and the content in this post might even be in contrast to what is the norm in a different culture. I write this blog post from my own perspective as a scientist working in the US today.\nNow, lots of people have written about this topic, but I do not think this topic is discussed enough with early career researchers and scientists, in particular at the stage of a graduate student or postdoctoral scientist. However, it can have a potentially large impact on someone’s career. Therefore, I thought I would write down some of the things I have thought about as important for helping me think about building my own brand in academia. Many of these ideas translate to building a brand in industry too. I hope this will help others think about these ideas for their own careers as scientists."

    "text": "Your “brand” is happening with or without your input\nThe first thing that should be mentioned is your “brand” is built with or without your input (whether you recognize it or not). You may have thought about this topic in the past (formally or informally) or you may not have. Either way, as you develop your career as a scientist you make choices (e.g. what areas to work in, what conferences to attend, how open is your science, whether to have a blog or not, etc) that other people perceive and interpret as your “brand”. It is worth taking a bit of time to think about what your brand is (or what you want your brand to be). It can not only help you in terms of becoming more well-known in your field, but it can also help influence your actual science (e.g. what you choose or not choose to work on)."

    "text": "Defining your brand\nIn terms of defining your brand, there are several questions that you might think about:\n\nWho are you? What makes you special?\nWhat do you stand for? For example, maybe you are passionate about open science and you prioritize publishing in open-access journals or publishing open source software.\nWho is your audience? This is important in terms of helping you understand your professional community as a scientist. What does the community value or not value? Does this align with your interests?\nWhat is your goal? This is a very personal question and there are no wrong answers. However, it is helpful to understand what your short-term and long-terms goals are. Some questions you might think about as you try to answer these two questions are:\n\nWhat motivates you?\nWhat projects have others complimented you on?\nWhich projects can I spend hours on and not feel overwhelmed or drained?\nFill in the following: “I want to be a leader in … &lt;&gt;”\n“In 5-10 years, I want to … &lt;&lt; insert thing you want to have accomplished &gt;&gt;”\n\n\nAnswering these (and other questions) can help you put your best foot forward for whatever type of job you take in the future (industry, academia, nonprofit, etc). These are also very helpful in defining what you want your brand to be."

    "section": "Actions to take towards building a brand as a scientist",
    "text": "Actions to take towards building a brand as a scientist\n\nThink of yourself as a self-startup\nThis is definitely true as a faculty member, but many aspects of this are true as a graduate student or postdoctoral scientist. However, when you are early in your career, it is true that you may have less say in what you work on, but as you grow into your career, you will likely have more and more say. Therefore, this section becomes more and more relevant.\nFor example, as you advance in your career there will likely be increasing opportunities for you to decide what to work on, how much time and effort to spend on the projects, how to convince others these are exciting projects, how to fund the projects, how to market the products you produce, how to lead teams of individuals to make progress on these projects. It is important to realize (earlier the better) that a lot of this is like starting up your own company. It takes many, many different skills (both scientific skills and professional development / soft skills) to be successful at it. You want to invest time and energy in developing these skills (sooner rather than later) as they are likely to have huge benefits down the road.\nFor example, let’s say you are grabbing a cup of coffee at a conference. You bump into someone in the coffee line from the last session that you were in. You have some small talk about the previous session and the person asks you about what do you or what do you work on? This might be very informal, but it is a great opportunity for you to have developed (and hopefully practiced) an elevator pitch. These are crucial in the world of startups. They require good communication skills and for you to have a solid understand of who you are, what you are passionate about, and why someone else should care about it. This one, informal conversation may not lead to anything, but in my experience, I have been surprised at how many times it does lead to something down the line (e.g. an email with a link to a paper relevant to your work that you were not aware of, a connection with someone at another institute who might think of you next time they are looking for speakers, a new collaboration, etc). These connections are similar in the world of startups and can sometimes be transformative to your career as a scientist.\n\n\nWant to develop a consistent brand\nAs you start to develop your brand, you want to think about consistency. Similar to the point above, this applies less to graduate students as they are likely to want to try different things out. However, this becomes more relevant as you grow into your career as a scientist. If your brand is inconsistent, it can be hard for others to understand what you are about, what your interests are, etc. If you did a pretty good job at defining your brand, this action item is a bit easier.\nFor example, if your audience is academic, theoretical computer scientists, you want to think about publishing in journals and attending conferences to present your work where other academic computer scientists are. It may not make much sense to attend psychology or biology conferences. However, maybe your audience is a diverse set of scientists bridging two fields (e.g. psychology and computer science) – therefore, you might be attending a broader set of conferences from both types of fields. Either way, you want to develop the skills (both scientific and professional development skills) needed to enable you to be successful in your field(s) of interest. Spending time on completely orthogonal skills that are not essential to building your brand, might be fun, but it is not necessarily going to help you move towards your goal. You want to develop a brand in the places where you will have a big impact and become well-known for your work.\nNow all this can potentially take years. It is unlikely you will do this over night. However, it is important to be thinking about consistency as you build your brand.\n\n\nLearn how to effectively self-promote your work\nI think we can all agree that contributing to science itself is essential for being a scientist. However, I often find people might not be good at the follow up step – namely, effectively communicating about their work to a broad audience in a succinct way, and promoting their own work (or work of collaborators). Putting a paper on bioRxiv or getting it through peer-review is, of course, a major accomplishment. However, the world we live in moves far too fast for me to be able to keep up with everyone’s work that I want to keep up with. It is incredibly helpful when a scientist takes that extra step to invest time and energy in promoting their work beyond just publishing a manuscript. If they were effective at this, I might not understand all the details, but I have a good sense of what their contribution is and why I might care about.\nThere are many great ways to go about doing this. Not all of them may be relevant for you. Social media is one way that is commonly discussed as a mechanism to promote your work. However, you may be in a situation where having a social media presence could potentially put you in harms way, so you prefer to not engage on social media platforms, but rather promote your work in other ways. I want to emphasize there is no one “correct” way of doing this! Find the tools that work for you.\nAll this being said, if you feel comfortable with having an online presence, it can be a helpful way to effectively self-promote your work. For example, creating a simple website (that is easy to maintain and update) can be helpful in keeping track of your accomplishments and sharing them with others. Investing time and energy in making a good CV (or resume depending on your field of interest) is another good way. Being able to quickly quantify your accomplishments if and when someone asks is another. Creating a blog and actively contribute to the blog is another.\n\n\nLeveraging social media to your benefit (“promote” your brand)\nIf you do decide to go down the social media route, you want to be selective with your platforms. Do not try to be on every platform. It can be a huge time sink to invest in the energy of being on just one or two platforms.\nLet’s say you choose to be active on Twitter. There are different strategies for engaging on the platform. For example, some folks engage a lot in a bidirectional fashion (i.e. they post a lot of tweets, but they also engage in many conversations with other people’s tweets). In contrast, others may choose to engage in a more unidirectional fashion (i.e. they use the platform to tweet about their own work and do not really engage in other people’s tweets). Other folks join the platform to just follow along with other people’s tweets and do not really engage in conversations at all. All of these have very different degrees of time required to engage with the platform. With that in mind, these are trade-offs that you make as a scientist. Time that you spent on e.g. Twitter is time that you could have spent working on science itself. However, not communicating about your science is also not great. You want to find a balance that works for you.\nIf you have a recent pre-print or paper out, one strategy to promote your work is to write a tweetorial. I have found this as an effective tool to distill scientific ideas (e.g. from a pre-print) down to something that is bite-sized and understandable in a few minutes. If someone reading the tweetorial thinks it is interesting, they might choose to click on the link to the pre-print and read a bit more. In contrast, if I had not taken the extra effort to distill these ideas down, this individual might have missed the pre-print all together. Having someone read about my work can influence their perception of my “brand”. For example, this individual might think of me next time they come across a similar topic or they might invite me to give a seminar on the topic.\nI will state that Jeff Leek wrote a great book titled How to be a Modern Scientist available on leanpub with a lot of these ideas. Highly recommended to check it out!\n\n\nEmbrace networking\nLet’s face it, networking can be transformative when it comes to being a scientist. It can open so many doors at a variety of levels. It can lead to future talk invitations, potential recommendation letters, future collaborations, potential internships. The list goes on and on.\nIt is also important to note the benefits you get out of networking and how you network can change as you grow into your career. For example, when you are just starting out as a graduate student, you may not know many folks at conferences. Here, it is all about putting yourself out there, introducing yourself to someone else, starting up a conversation over a coffee break, attending poster sessions, asking questions to speakers at the end of sessions, etc. As you grow in your career as a scientist, you start to develop professional friendships with colleagues and you may choose to connect with them at an annual conference in your professional field.\nFor example, one strategy I have found effective for me in my current stage is ahead of the conference, I schedule breakfasts / coffee breaks / lunches / dinners with people that I want to see there. It ensures that I am able to connect and network with the folks that I am most interested in connecting with. I may or may not have met these individuals before. It all depends on what the purpose is of the meeting. For example, if I am a graduate student wanting to learn more about opportunities for doing a posdoc in a different a department, I might reach out to someone from that department who is attending the conference and ask to meet for 15 mins to ask questions. Alternatively, I may catching up with an old friend. Either way, I cannot emphasize enough how much networking has helped my career and helped shape my “brand”.\n\n\nRe-invent your brand as you grow / change over time\nThe last thing I want to mention is that your brand may change over time. As you as a scientist evolves, your brand may need to evolve. Recognizing when that is happening and embracing it is not only healthy, but completely normal."

    "text": "With the rise of large genetic and genomic datasets, an important challenge is how to leverage these data to better understand how genetics and genomics contributes to human disease. Historically, machine learning and statistics have been used to infer associations or identify differences in genomic data, to build predictive models, and to identify genetic elements important to disease and cellular processes. Most recently, there has been great progress made in leveraging core ideas from deep learning to solve important and open challenges with these data. For example, a search on PubMed for (deep learning) AND ((genetics) OR (genomics)) in June 2025 shows great interest in these topics (Figure 1). One challenge we face as educators and instructors is how to translate the fast-paced world of research at the intersection of deep learning and genomics to the classroom so that we can discuss both the historical context of these models along with their performance and applications to large genetic and genomic datasets actively being generated today.\nTowards this goal, we recently developed and taught a graduate-level discussion-based course titled “Advanced Topics in Genomic Data Analysis” in Spring 2025 at the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (EN.580.743.01). The purpose of this post is to provide an overview of the course structure, a description of the papers that were used in the Spring 2025 course, and reflections on the course afterwards. Our goal in writing this summary of the course is to help inspire other instructors to develop similar courses at their own universities and institutions so that students there can bridge both the historical context of these deep learning models and be able to critically discuss and assess their applications to large datasets today."

In addition, we designed the course to be a graduate-level course with a primary target population of PhD students. However, we were inclusive to a range of levels including undergraduate students with strong research experience in these topics. Finally, while we did not have required textbooks, we suggested supplemental reading materials including Molecular Biology of the Cell, An Owner’s Guide to the Human Genome, An Introduction to Statistical Learning, and Deep Learning to help fill in potential gaps ranging from molecular biology, human genetics, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning."

On the first day, we described to the students the course expectations which were that students will present and lead class discussions on papers in the current literature. In addition, students would also complete two small pre-defined analysis assignments using publicly available data, in addition to a final project of the student’s choosing. In terms of the number of presentations to give, we asked students to sign up to give presentations for two papers as a primary presenter and for two papers as a secondary/supporting presenter. The purpose of this was to ensure that each paper had at least two presenters so that they could discuss the paper with each other if they had questions about it. The number of presentations we asked students to participate in as a primary or secondary presenter was a function of the number of days we met over the course of the semester along with the number of students enrolled in the class. In our class, we met twice a week over the course of a semester. To leave room for final project presentations at the end, we planned for 24 presentations over 12 weeks, including the first day where we gave an overview of the course. Finally, all students were notified that they were expected to read the papers in advance of the class and be prepared to discuss and ask questions as the papers were being presented."

The first mini-assignment practiced using the tensorQTL package for extremely fast QTL calling and the second-mini assignment practiced using scVI for batch integration with single-cell RNA-sequencing data. In terms of the writing portion, students were asked to pick two papers that we read in class (any paper up through the due date of the assignment) and write an alternative introduction (not the abstract), which should include introducing the topic and the importance of the paper (roughly 6-10 sentences). The purpose was to practice re-writing the introduction for different audiences. For example, pick an introduction that appears to target a broad audience and write new introductory sentences as if you were targeting more specialized experts in the topic of the paper. For the second paper, the student was asked to do the opposite. Finally, we also aimed to have each student practice writing a “Methods” section by picking a paper we read in class where they thought the methods were unclear and requiring them to re-write a key piece (1-2 paragraphs) of the methods section. It should be noted that we were not penalizing right or wrong answers here, but rather we aimed for students to improve their writing of details."

In terms of topics, there were two options:\n\nUsing a published paper with publicly available data, replicate 2-3 key results from the paper that used machine learning or statistical approach in application of genomic data and extend it with at two additional, related analyses (i.e. 2 figures) of your own that would be interesting such as:\n\nComparing their method to an additional baseline not shown\nTesting with a different performance metric\nModifying their approach in some way and showing results with that\nAdditional exploration of results such as different visualization, gene set enrichment analysis or other biologically-revealing analysis.\n\nApply a machine learning method to a particular biological problem or dataset and evaluate its performance in comparison to a baseline approach. There should be some aspect of novelty:\n\nA “twist” on an existing machine learning method\nResults that provide new insight into a biological question\nApplication of a method to a data type or problem to which it has not previously been applied\n\n\nWe encouraged individuals to work in groups of 2 people, but students could also complete the project on their own if they preferred. The project could have overlap with research in a lab, or with any other project, but we just asked students to state which parts of the project were specifically for this class. In terms of scope, we strongly encouraged projects that could be completed in the time available. For example, the project was primarily intended to practice with public data and explore existing machine learning algorithms, but it could potentially lead to a larger research project going forward beyond the class.\nIn terms of deliverables, there were three components required for the final project, each with their own due dates. The deliverables were a (1) set of “specific aims”, (2) a final project presentation given in class, and (3) a final write up of the methods and results including source code, a link to the data, and a statement describing any potential overlap with ongoing research projects outside of class. We prioritized asking students to make their code reproducible, including all steps of your analysis from preprocessing to producing final figures and results shown in your writeup.\nThe specific aims page should be 1 page in length and follow an NIH-style specific aims page in terms of other format requirements, not the scope of the project. For the final project presentations, we asked students to sign up for a 10-15 minute presentation in class over the course of two classes. Students were not expected to have finished the project by the project presentation, but the presentation needed to contain meaningful results. The presentation also allowed us to provide feedback before the final project writeup was due."

    "text": "Recommendations for future versions of the course\nLooking forward, we hope to build on the success of this course, with an eye toward further improving the experience and impact for students. Key considerations are course content, logistics, and discussion management. The content, including the broad topics and papers selected, was a highlight of the class in the last iteration. We hope to maintain the mix of foundational and cutting-edge papers, and recognize that this will require refreshing the list regularly to keep up with the fast-moving field. Logistically, the class size of 10-20 students was close to optimal, balancing lively discussion where everyone could participate, without being so small that each student had to lead the discussion too often. Relatedly, the diverse make-up of the class, covering a range of backgrounds and degree programs, was a benefit, where some students could help explain detailed statistical methods, and others could provide insight into biological mechanisms or motivations. Areas for improvement in the course logistics include providing students with additional example materials: sample successful projects, examples of strong discussion lead presentations, and very clear information about grading criteria.\nThe final area for consideration is how to maintain active, interesting, and thorough discussions of the material. Providing example discussion presentations will help kick things off in a good direction, demonstrating the need to cover methods and results and to raise probing questions and discussion points. We find, however, that it is also important throughout the course to keep an eye on discussion and participation, to chime in occasionally when discussion dies down, and remind participants and discussion leaders of their roles, or gently call on students who are not participating. Finally, it is absolutely essential to make sure students feel encouraged to have a very open discussion without judgement, and that they can ask questions that may feel silly, reveal a lack of understanding, or alternatively may be critical of a published paper’s content or writing style. Cutting edge papers can be hard to understand, controversial, and even occasionally have mistakes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Whenever I am wrapping up a project for work (e.g. writing up a manuscript to submit), it’s often the case that the project as a whole contains both of the following:\n\nA set of scripts (e.g. .Rmd files) that analyzes some specific data.\nA software package (e.g R package) often generalizing some of the functions from #1 that someone else might be able to use to help in their own data analysis.\n\nBoth of these are incredibly useful for many reasons, but in different ways.\nFor example, in the first category, the idea is to produce set of scripts to enable reproducibility of the specific analyses presented in the project (e.g. peer-reviewed manuscript). Also, this is a way to provide larger details on the motivation or intentional decisions behind the choices made in the data analysis. There are a variety of reasons someone down the line, including myself 6 months or 6 years from now, might be interested in the exact code written in this project, including debugging something, wanting to build upon the work, or challenging the work.\nIn the second category, the idea is that I have identified a piece of code that can be generalized into a function that might be useful to someone else, including myself, for a future project. There are many best practices behind developing R packages, but one that wasn’t very clear to me at first when I starting writing my own software was:\n\nSoftware and data analysis repositories are not the same and should be kept in separate places.\n\n\nThe problem?\nLet me give you an example of something I’ve seen lately. Someone publishes a pre-print or a paper with a link to a GitHub repository to the foobar software package. I click on the link see the following structure:\n\n\n\nfoobar project directory\n  |-- .here\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- README.md\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- NAMESPACE\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- DESCRIPTION\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- LICENSE\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- foobar.Rproj\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- R/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- man/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- vignettes/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- preprocessing_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- simulations_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- real_analyses_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- fig_scripts_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  o-- data_for_paper/\n     o-- object of type(s):dir\n\n\nThe problem with this project directory is that it is mixing up both #1 and #2 above and placing everything in one directory. This places an undue burden on a potential user to have to sift through these two types of code and depending on what they are interested in using, they might have to make modifications for how the software is installed.\n\n\nHow to improve?\nA better way to go is to keep these two in separate directories or repositories called foobar and foobar_paper. Specifically, the scripts to reproduce the analyses should be place in one repository (e.g. called foobar_paper or foorbar_project):\n\n\n\nfoobar paper analysis directory\n  |-- .here\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- README.md\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- preprocessing_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- simulations_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- real_analyses_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- fig_scripts_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  o-- data_for_paper/\n     o-- object of type(s):dir\n\n\nand the software that generalizes some code into a function for others to use should be placed in a different repository (e.g. called foobar, etc):\n\n\n\nfoobar software directory\n  |-- .here\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- README.md\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- NAMESPACE\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- DESCRIPTION\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- LICENSE\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- foo_package.Rproj\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- R/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- man/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  o-- vignettes/\n     o-- object of type(s):dir\n\n\nThis is good for a few reasons including:\n\nIt keeps the two separate, but equally important, concepts of specific analysis code vs generalized code in different places, with links between the two, if useful.\nIt keeps the repositories as lightweight as possible.\nInstallation of the foobar software package is more straightforward.\nIt enables you to potentially create new generalized functions in the future (i.e. make new software packages) that might have been originally derived from this project.\n(Update 2022-03-02): It makes it more likely that the foobar software package is reusable independently of the paper code or context (h/t Rahul Karnik).\n\n\n\nAlternatives\n(Update 2022-03-02): Konrad Rudolph made a great point that there are alternative approaches to these nested package approaches that enable organizing R code in a modular way without the ned to wrap code into a formal R package. For example, using modules from box. The idea is you can write “modular code by treating files and folders of R code as independent (potentially nested) modules, without requiring the user to wrap reusable code into packages”.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThank you to the listdown R package from Michael Kane, which automated the folder structures above."

While much has been written about statistical thinking, a complementary form of thinking that appears in the practice of data analysis is design thinking – the problem-solving process to understand the people for whom a product is being designed.\nAnalytic Design Theory is the study of how data analyses are conducted in the real world taking into account both the perspectives of both the analyst and the stakeholder or consumer of the analysis. Aspects of this include characterizing variation between analyses, developing measures of quality, success, and usability, modeling the analytic process, and considering what makes data analyses more or less trustworthy. Analytic design theory is driven by the need to scale the training of data analysis and to continuously improve the quality of analyses."
