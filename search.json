I can’t say it has been a walk in the park — many hard lessons learned —, but I can say I love what I get to do everyday and feel incredibly fortunate to work here with such great colleagues and students!\nSo while reflecting on this past year, I have been thinking about many great blogposts I read containing information about how to enjoy being on the tenure-track and not stress out about it, including one of favorites, The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life. I don’t want reinvent the wheel, but thought I would echo a bit of advice that I’ve learned this year in terms of time management and productivity.\n\nLearn to polietly say no as much as humanly possible. Honestly, this is the thing I still struggle the most with, but I constantly remind myself everyday. Protect your time. It is much more valuable than you could ever imagine.\n\n\n\nBeing productive does not mean needing to spend hours in the office or working on the weekends. Learn to proritize and outsource. You can absolutely have a wonderful work-life balance and crush it as principal investigator (PI) with the right support team.\nIf all else fails and you feel like you are wasting time / spinning your wheels on something that’s confusing or unclear (e.g. the grants process, effort reporting, all things related to your home department or institution, or just need to vent), — which happened to me many, many times the past year — follow the flow chart given to me by one of my awesome faculty mentors, Jeff Leek and ask for help:\n\n\nHope everyone’s year is off to a great start!"

However, another important component of being a scientist is learning how to build your “brand” as a scientist.\nI want to preface this blog post acknowledging there are huge differences across cultures and the content in this post might even be in contrast to what is the norm in a different culture. I write this blog post from my own perspective as a scientist working in the US today.\nNow, lots of people have written about this topic, but I do not think this topic is discussed enough with early career researchers and scientists, in particular at the stage of a graduate student or postdoctoral scientist. However, it can have a potentially large impact on someone’s career. Therefore, I thought I would write down some of the things I have thought about as important for helping me think about building my own brand in academia. Many of these ideas translate to building a brand in industry too. I hope this will help others think about these ideas for their own careers as scientists."

You may have thought about this topic in the past (formally or informally) or you may not have. Either way, as you develop your career as a scientist you make choices (e.g. what areas to work in, what conferences to attend, how open is your science, whether to have a blog or not, etc) that other people perceive and interpret as your “brand”. It is worth taking a bit of time to think about what your brand is (or what you want your brand to be). It can not only help you in terms of becoming more well-known in your field, but it can also help influence your actual science (e.g. what you choose or not choose to work on)."

This is important in terms of helping you understand your professional community as a scientist. What does the community value or not value? Does this align with your interests?\nWhat is your goal? This is a very personal question and there are no wrong answers. However, it is helpful to understand what your short-term and long-terms goals are. Some questions you might think about as you try to answer these two questions are:\n\nWhat motivates you?\nWhat projects have others complimented you on?\nWhich projects can I spend hours on and not feel overwhelmed or drained?\nFill in the following: “I want to be a leader in … &lt;&gt;”\n“In 5-10 years, I want to … &lt;&lt; insert thing you want to have accomplished &gt;&gt;”\n\n\nAnswering these (and other questions) can help you put your best foot forward for whatever type of job you take in the future (industry, academia, nonprofit, etc).

    "text": "Actions to take towards building a brand as a scientist\n\nThink of yourself as a self-startup\nThis is definitely true as a faculty member, but many aspects of this are true as a graduate student or postdoctoral scientist. However, when you are early in your career, it is true that you may have less say in what you work on, but as you grow into your career, you will likely have more and more say. Therefore, this section becomes more and more relevant.\nFor example, as you advance in your career there will likely be increasing opportunities for you to decide what to work on, how much time and effort to spend on the projects, how to convince others these are exciting projects, how to fund the projects, how to market the products you produce, how to lead teams of individuals to make progress on these projects. It is important to realize (earlier the better) that a lot of this is like starting up your own company. It takes many, many different skills (both scientific skills and professional development / soft skills) to be successful at it. You want to invest time and energy in developing these skills (sooner rather than later) as they are likely to have huge benefits down the road.\nFor example, let’s say you are grabbing a cup of coffee at a conference. You bump into someone in the coffee line from the last session that you were in. You have some small talk about the previous session and the person asks you about what do you or what do you work on? This might be very informal, but it is a great opportunity for you to have developed (and hopefully practiced) an elevator pitch. These are crucial in the world of startups. They require good communication skills and for you to have a solid understand of who you are, what you are passionate about, and why someone else should care about it. This one, informal conversation may not lead to anything, but in my experience, I have been surprised at how many times it does lead to something down the line (e.g. an email with a link to a paper relevant to your work that you were not aware of, a connection with someone at another institute who might think of you next time they are looking for speakers, a new collaboration, etc). These connections are similar in the world of startups and can sometimes be transformative to your career as a scientist.\n\n\nWant to develop a consistent brand\nAs you start to develop your brand, you want to think about consistency. Similar to the point above, this applies less to graduate students as they are likely to want to try different things out. However, this becomes more relevant as you grow into your career as a scientist. If your brand is inconsistent, it can be hard for others to understand what you are about, what your interests are, etc. If you did a pretty good job at defining your brand, this action item is a bit easier.\nFor example, if your audience is academic, theoretical computer scientists, you want to think about publishing in journals and attending conferences to present your work where other academic computer scientists are. It may not make much sense to attend psychology or biology conferences. However, maybe your audience is a diverse set of scientists bridging two fields (e.g. psychology and computer science) – therefore, you might be attending a broader set of conferences from both types of fields. Either way, you want to develop the skills (both scientific and professional development skills) needed to enable you to be successful in your field(s) of interest. Spending time on completely orthogonal skills that are not essential to building your brand, might be fun, but it is not necessarily going to help you move towards your goal. You want to develop a brand in the places where you will have a big impact and become well-known for your work.\nNow all this can potentially take years. It is unlikely you will do this over night. However, it is important to be thinking about consistency as you build your brand.\n\n\nLearn how to effectively self-promote your work\nI think we can all agree that contributing to science itself is essential for being a scientist. However, I often find people might not be good at the follow up step – namely, effectively communicating about their work to a broad audience in a succinct way, and promoting their own work (or work of collaborators). Putting a paper on bioRxiv or getting it through peer-review is, of course, a major accomplishment. However, the world we live in moves far too fast for me to be able to keep up with everyone’s work that I want to keep up with. It is incredibly helpful when a scientist takes that extra step to invest time and energy in promoting their work beyond just publishing a manuscript. If they were effective at this, I might not understand all the details, but I have a good sense of what their contribution is and why I might care about.\nThere are many great ways to go about doing this. Not all of them may be relevant for you. Social media is one way that is commonly discussed as a mechanism to promote your work. However, you may be in a situation where having a social media presence could potentially put you in harms way, so you prefer to not engage on social media platforms, but rather promote your work in other ways. I want to emphasize there is no one “correct” way of doing this! Find the tools that work for you.\nAll this being said, if you feel comfortable with having an online presence, it can be a helpful way to effectively self-promote your work. For example, creating a simple website (that is easy to maintain and update) can be helpful in keeping track of your accomplishments and sharing them with others. Investing time and energy in making a good CV (or resume depending on your field of interest) is another good way. Being able to quickly quantify your accomplishments if and when someone asks is another. Creating a blog and actively contribute to the blog is another.\n\n\nLeveraging social media to your benefit (“promote” your brand)\nIf you do decide to go down the social media route, you want to be selective with your platforms. Do not try to be on every platform. It can be a huge time sink to invest in the energy of being on just one or two platforms.\nLet’s say you choose to be active on Twitter. There are different strategies for engaging on the platform. For example, some folks engage a lot in a bidirectional fashion (i.e. they post a lot of tweets, but they also engage in many conversations with other people’s tweets). In contrast, others may choose to engage in a more unidirectional fashion (i.e. they use the platform to tweet about their own work and do not really engage in other people’s tweets). Other folks join the platform to just follow along with other people’s tweets and do not really engage in conversations at all. All of these have very different degrees of time required to engage with the platform. With that in mind, these are trade-offs that you make as a scientist. Time that you spent on e.g. Twitter is time that you could have spent working on science itself. However, not communicating about your science is also not great. You want to find a balance that works for you.\nIf you have a recent pre-print or paper out, one strategy to promote your work is to write a tweetorial. I have found this as an effective tool to distill scientific ideas (e.g. from a pre-print) down to something that is bite-sized and understandable in a few minutes. If someone reading the tweetorial thinks it is interesting, they might choose to click on the link to the pre-print and read a bit more. In contrast, if I had not taken the extra effort to distill these ideas down, this individual might have missed the pre-print all together. Having someone read about my work can influence their perception of my “brand”. For example, this individual might think of me next time they come across a similar topic or they might invite me to give a seminar on the topic.\nI will state that Jeff Leek wrote a great book titled How to be a Modern Scientist available on leanpub with a lot of these ideas. Highly recommended to check it out!\n\n\nEmbrace networking\nLet’s face it, networking can be transformative when it comes to being a scientist. It can open so many doors at a variety of levels. It can lead to future talk invitations, potential recommendation letters, future collaborations, potential internships. The list goes on and on.\nIt is also important to note the benefits you get out of networking and how you network can change as you grow into your career. For example, when you are just starting out as a graduate student, you may not know many folks at conferences. Here, it is all about putting yourself out there, introducing yourself to someone else, starting up a conversation over a coffee break, attending poster sessions, asking questions to speakers at the end of sessions, etc. As you grow in your career as a scientist, you start to develop professional friendships with colleagues and you may choose to connect with them at an annual conference in your professional field.\nFor example, one strategy I have found effective for me in my current stage is ahead of the conference, I schedule breakfasts / coffee breaks / lunches / dinners with people that I want to see there. It ensures that I am able to connect and network with the folks that I am most interested in connecting with. I may or may not have met these individuals before. It all depends on what the purpose is of the meeting. For example, if I am a graduate student wanting to learn more about opportunities for doing a posdoc in a different a department, I might reach out to someone from that department who is attending the conference and ask to meet for 15 mins to ask questions. Alternatively, I may catching up with an old friend. Either way, I cannot emphasize enough how much networking has helped my career and helped shape my “brand”.\n\n\nRe-invent your brand as you grow / change over time\nThe last thing I want to mention is that your brand may change over time. As you as a scientist evolves, your brand may need to evolve. Recognizing when that is happening and embracing it is not only healthy, but completely normal."

Quantile normalization is one of the most widely used multi-sample normalization tools for applications including genotyping arrays, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), DNA methylation (DNAm), ChIP-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and brain imaging. However, quantile normalization relies on assumptions about the data-generation process that are not appropriate in some contexts. To address this, I developed two statistical methods and open-source software for normalizing high-throughput data (1, 2). More recently, I have developed methods and software for correcting and removing compositional biases found in metagenomic data (3), and co-expression analysis of correlated genes (4).\n\nHicks SC, Irizarry RA (2015). quantro: a data-driven approach to guide the choice of an appropriate normalization method.

This intra-sample cellular heterogeneity is a source of variation than can sometimes be confounded with an outcome or phenotype of interest. If unaccounted for, false positives ensue. Previously, I developed statistical methods to estimate the cell type proportions in whole blood DNAm samples (1). Currently, I am developing cellular deconvolution methods for human brain RNA-seq data (R01MH13183). One major source of variation in brain issue is how the cell sizes and cell abundance varies across cell types, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of cell type proportions in bulk RNA-seq (2). I recently developed a data-driven method to estimate the RNA abundance from cell types in heterogeneous tissues using sc/snRNA-seq and smFISH (3).\n\nHicks SC, Irizarry RA (2019). methylCC: technology-independent estimation of cell type composition using differentially methylated regions.

To address this, we developed a fast, scalable statistical framework for feature selection and dimensionality reduction using generalized principal component analysis (GLM-PCA) for scRNA-seq data, which permits the identification of low-dimensional representations of cells measured with unique molecular identifiers (UMI) count data using a multinomial model (2). More recently, we developed a probabilistic model to identify low-quality cells in scRNA-seq data (3). Finally, we have evaluated probability distributions to accurately model single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data and showed how snRNA-seq has a gene length bias present in both exonic and intronic reads (4).\n\nHicks SC, Townes FW, Teng M, Irizarry RA (2018).

Most importantly, they need to be fast, scalable, and memory efficient. For example, the k-means algorithm is a classic algorithm used in the analysis of scRNA-seq data. However, with increasing sizes of single-cell data, new methods are needed that are fast, scalable and memory-efficient. To address this, we implemented the mini-batch optimization for k-means clustering proposed in Sculley (2010) for large single cell sequencing data (1), including fast and memory-efficient k-means++ center finding with distance measures designed for count data and probability distributions (2). The mini-batch k-means algorithm can be run with data stored in memory or on disk (e.g. HDF5 file format). In addition, we have developed fast and scalable discordance metrics to use as a performance metric to evaluate the predicted labels for a general dissimilarity measure (e.g. Euclidean distance) (3). Finally, we have also implemented scalable data infrastructure to store and access single-cell data that can be explored with hierarchical structures (e.g. cell types) (4).\n\nHicks SC, Liu R, Ni Y, Purdom E, Risso D.

For example, these count-based models, such as Poisson or negative binomial, can be generalized using the Tweedie family of distributions, which we used to develop a statistical method to identify differentially expressed genes (1). Similarly, we have developed methods for differential pseudotime analysis (gene expression or cell abundance) with multiple samples per group using B-splines (2).\n\nMallick H, Chatterjee Su., Chowdhury S, Chatterjee Sa., Rahnavard A, Hicks SC.

This is highly relevant to public health because HGSOC is a particularly deadly cancer that is often only identified at late stage and treatment options are limited. The long-term impact of this project will be a key step towards developing targeted treatments for HGSOCs. Towards this goal, we demonstrated that genetic demultiplexing from single-cell cancer samples can be used for better experimental design and increase cost savings (1). Most recently, we performed a systematic benchmark of algorithms for bulk deconvolution for HGSOC tumors (2) and showed how applyings these algorithms in the context of high-grade serous ovarian cancer reveals compositional differences in subtypes.\n\nWeber LM, Hippen AA, Hickey PF, Berrett KC, Gertz J, Doherty JA, Greene CS, Hicks SC.

For example, we recently used snRNA-seq to explore activity-regulated gene expression across cell types of the mouse hippocampus (2).\n\nTran MN, Maynard KR, Spangler A, Collado-Torres L, Sadashivaiah V, Tippani M, Barry BK, Hancock DB, Hicks SC, Kleinman JE, Hyde TM, Martinowich K, Jaffe A.

    "text": "Analysis of genomic data with spatial resolution\nSpatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT), the Nature Methods 2020 Method of the Year, is poised to transform our understanding of how the spatial organization and communication of cells in complex tissues. These technologies have created an unprecedented opportunity to investigate important biological questions that can only be answered in a spatial context. However, these technologies also brings new statistical, computational and methodological challenges.\n\nData storage and data visualization\nTo address some of these challenges, we have developed standardized data infrastructure to storage SRT data within the Bioconductor framework (1) along with tools to statistially visualize multi-dimensional data in a 2D space, including embedding visualizations or spatial visualizations (2). Other tools include interactively visualizing SRT data (3-4). Most recently, we developed a performant web-based interactive visualization tool for spatially-resolved transcriptomics experiments called Samui Browser, which leverages GeoTIFF file formats and OpenLayers for geomaps (5).\n\nRighelli D, Weber LM, Crowell HL, Pardo B, Collado-Torres L, Ghazanfar S, Lun ATL, Hicks SC, Risso D (2021).

    "text": "Data science education\nAn increase in demand for statistics and data science education has led to changes in curriculum, specifically an increase in computing. While this has led to more applied courses, students still struggle with effectively deriving knowledge from data and solving real-world problems. In 1999, Deborah Nolan and Terry Speed argued the solution was to teach courses through in-depth case studies derived from interesting scientific questions with nontrivial solutions that leave room for different analyses of the data. This innovative framework teaches the student to make important connections between the scientific question, data and statistical concepts that only come from hands-on experience analyzing data (1-2).\n\nHicks SC, Irizarry RA (2018). A Guide to Teaching Data Science. The American Statistician.\nHicks SC (2017). Greater Data Science Ahead.

This project was selected as a High-Impact Project in 2019-2020 by the Bloomberg American Health Initiative and Bloomberg Philanthropies (2).

While much has been written about statistical thinking, a complementary form of thinking that appears in the practice of data analysis is design thinking – the problem-solving process to understand the people for whom a product is being designed. There can be significant or subtle differences in how a data analyst (or producer of a data analysis) constructs, creates, or designs a data analysis, including differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. These choices can affect the data analysis products themselves and the experience of the consumer of the data analysis. Therefore, the role of a producer can be thought of as designing the data analysis with a set of design principles (1,2). Our work leads to several insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to describe and evaluate (3) data analyses based on the design principles for data analysis, and a framework for diagnosing data analytic problems in the classroom (4).\n\nD’Agostino McGowan L, Peng RD, Hicks SC.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the last few weeks, there have been quite a few great pre-prints posted on bioRxiv related to the analysis of a popular type of genomics data, called single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). The idea with this data is that you can measure genome-wide features (such as genes or transcripts) in individual cells, in contrast to more traditional bulk RNA-sequencing experiments where for each feature, you get an average of gene expression across all the cells in the sample. One key insight that has been widely talked about in the world of scRNA-seq data analysis is the over inflation of the number of zeros, or sparsity, of the data compared to bulk RNA-sequencing measurements. Therefore, for several years now, lots of work has been focused on developing zero-inflation aware methods. Many early contributions were based on what are commonly referred to as plate-based protocols as opposed to the more recently developed droplet-based protocols that have what are called unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) – little barcodes attached to the ends of the mRNA that remove certain biases related to PCR amplification. Here, I wanted to write up a quick blogpost summarizing one of the key takeaways that have come out from some recent pre-prints."

    "text": "Droplet-based scRNA-seq data with UMI counts are not zero inflated\nThere were hints of this in 2017 [Vieth et al. (2017) and a blogpost by Valentine Svensson in 2017], but several recent pre-prints have come out supporting this idea. Townes et al. (2019) showed UMI count data derived from negative control scRNA-seq datasets (i.e. identical RNA was added to droplets and sequenced aka we do not expect any biological variation) are well-described by multinomial distributions, which can be approximated by Poisson and negative binomial distributions. A few days later Hafemeister and Satija (2019) independently published similar results, with a different error distribution. The next day, Svensson et al. (2019) took the analysis from his 2017 blogpost and converted it into a pre-print. Here, he took five negative control droplet scRNA-seq datasets (again, identical RNA was added to droplets and sequenced aka we do not expect any biological variation), and showed how the data – well 4 out of 5 datasets – dropseq was a bit wonky) fit nicely to a negative binomial distribution. This matches what previous authors have found Vieth et al. (2017). Svensson argues this suggests an over-abundance of zeros in biological data is likely real biological variation, as opposed to technical variation, which also been suggested by Andrews and Hemberg (2018) as a way to identify genes that contain biologically meaningful information.\nBoth Townes and Svensson hypothesize that the zero-inflation in non-UMI data is related to the outliers in PCR duplicated counts, which is corrected by the use of UMIs. Svensson does not perform a similar assessment of plate-based scRNA-seq datasets because no comparable negative control data exists or plate-based methods. However, Svensson goes on to hypothesize that plate-based methods might introduce an additional layer out count noise leading to over dispersion and manifesting as additional zeros.\nWhat does this mean for the field going forward? This means that the choice of methods used for the analysis of scRNA-seq data will likely vary depending on the type of protocol used to generate that data. I guess this is not so suprising, but methods do matter and the assumptions behind those methods are important to think about. However, ultimately I’m just excited to see such great work from multiple groups all converge on a similar idea. Hope this helps to move the field forward."

    "text": "Whenever I am wrapping up a project for work (e.g. writing up a manuscript to submit), it’s often the case that the project as a whole contains both of the following:\n\nA set of scripts (e.g. .Rmd files) that analyzes some specific data.\nA software package (e.g R package) often generalizing some of the functions from #1 that someone else might be able to use to help in their own data analysis.\n\nBoth of these are incredibly useful for many reasons, but in different ways.\nFor example, in the first category, the idea is to produce set of scripts to enable reproducibility of the specific analyses presented in the project (e.g. peer-reviewed manuscript). Also, this is a way to provide larger details on the motivation or intentional decisions behind the choices made in the data analysis. There are a variety of reasons someone down the line, including myself 6 months or 6 years from now, might be interested in the exact code written in this project, including debugging something, wanting to build upon the work, or challenging the work.\nIn the second category, the idea is that I have identified a piece of code that can be generalized into a function that might be useful to someone else, including myself, for a future project. There are many best practices behind developing R packages, but one that wasn’t very clear to me at first when I starting writing my own software was:\n\nSoftware and data analysis repositories are not the same and should be kept in separate places.\n\n\nThe problem?\nLet me give you an example of something I’ve seen lately. Someone publishes a pre-print or a paper with a link to a GitHub repository to the foobar software package. I click on the link see the following structure:\n\n\n\nfoobar project directory\n  |-- .here\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- README.md\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- NAMESPACE\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- DESCRIPTION\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- LICENSE\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- foobar.Rproj\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- R/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- man/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- vignettes/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- preprocessing_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- simulations_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- real_analyses_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- fig_scripts_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  o-- data_for_paper/\n     o-- object of type(s):dir\n\n\nThe problem with this project directory is that it is mixing up both #1 and #2 above and placing everything in one directory. This places an undue burden on a potential user to have to sift through these two types of code and depending on what they are interested in using, they might have to make modifications for how the software is installed.\n\n\nHow to improve?\nA better way to go is to keep these two in separate directories or repositories called foobar and foobar_paper. Specifically, the scripts to reproduce the analyses should be place in one repository (e.g. called foobar_paper or foorbar_project):\n\n\n\nfoobar paper analysis directory\n  |-- .here\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- README.md\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- preprocessing_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- simulations_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- real_analyses_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- fig_scripts_for_paper/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  o-- data_for_paper/\n     o-- object of type(s):dir\n\n\nand the software that generalizes some code into a function for others to use should be placed in a different repository (e.g. called foobar, etc):\n\n\n\nfoobar software directory\n  |-- .here\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- README.md\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- NAMESPACE\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- DESCRIPTION\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- LICENSE\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- foo_package.Rproj\n  |  o-- object of type(s):file\n  |-- R/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  |-- man/\n  |  o-- object of type(s):dir\n  o-- vignettes/\n     o-- object of type(s):dir\n\n\nThis is good for a few reasons including:\n\nIt keeps the two separate, but equally important, concepts of specific analysis code vs generalized code in different places, with links between the two, if useful.\nIt keeps the repositories as lightweight as possible.\nInstallation of the foobar software package is more straightforward.\nIt enables you to potentially create new generalized functions in the future (i.e. make new software packages) that might have been originally derived from this project.\n(Update 2022-03-02): It makes it more likely that the foobar software package is reusable independently of the paper code or context (h/t Rahul Karnik).\n\n\n\nAlternatives\n(Update 2022-03-02): Konrad Rudolph made a great point that there are alternative approaches to these nested package approaches that enable organizing R code in a modular way without the ned to wrap code into a formal R package. For example, using modules from box. The idea is you can write “modular code by treating files and folders of R code as independent (potentially nested) modules, without requiring the user to wrap reusable code into packages”.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThank you to the listdown R package from Michael Kane, which automated the folder structures above."
