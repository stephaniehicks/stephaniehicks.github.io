<font size= "5"> **Associate Professor of [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/) and [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/)** </font>

Stephanie Hicks is an applied statistician working at the intersection of genomics and biomedical data science. 

Her research addresses statistical and computational challenges in single-cell genomics, epigenomics, and spatial transcriptomics leading to an improved understanding of human health and disease. Specifically, she develops fast and scalable [computational methods](projects.qmd) and [open-source software](software.qmd) for biomedical data analysis.

Her research philosophy is [problem-forward](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2013-05-29-what-statistics-should-do-about-big-data-problem-forward-not-solution-backward/): she develops computational methods and software that are motivated by concrete problems, often with real-world, messy data. This philosophy permeates into her contributions to statistics and data science [education](teaching.qmd), and service to the profession including being an advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion.

She is also a co-host of the [The Corresponding Author](https://twitter.com/CorrespondAuth) podcast, member of the [Editorial Board for _Genome Biology_](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board), an Associate Editor for [Reproducibility](https://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide/) at the [_Journal of the American Statistical Association_](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/uasa20/current), and co-founder of [R-Ladies Baltimore](https://rladies-baltimore.github.io).
